        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Shana Zheng. I am currently a first-year undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside, majoring in Pre-Business. I am hoping to concentrate in Management as my career path of interest surrounds Managemment and HR. In terms of past experience, I have worked as a team member at Vitality Bowls, taking orders with great customer service, preparing food according to proper procedure, and keeping the store in a tidy condition. Being hired during the summer, I had to adjust to the quick paced, high-stress environment of a smoothie shop during the summer within a short training period and successfully carried out my duties for the few months I was there. <br><br>

        In high school, I also worked as an acrobatics teacher. I managed weekly classes of 5-20 with children ages 3-14, teaching them proper progressions, safety precautions, and most of all, acrobatics. Being the youngest and least experienced staff member on the acrobatics teaching team, I had to learn quickly. I keenly observed my fellow teachers and always looked to further improve my teaching skills. By the end of high school, I could communicate with the older teachers and young children and executed weekly classes with great ease. A couple personal qualities of mine that stand out are my growth-based mindset and adaptability. I hold myself to a very high standard of learning and work quality. I am always looking to further improve myself, improve my work, and my learning. I am also a very adaptable as I do not dwell on the things that have already happened. As soon as I am faced with a problem or an unexpected bump in the road, I always immediately look to the next best step and look to execute that.<br><br>

        In terms of club experience, in high school I held various board positions across a multitude of clubs. I was Project Chair, Secretary, and eventually, President of Key Club and PR/Media and Lead Choreographer of our school's Korean American Student Association. As President, I directed an 8-person officer team to execute weekly, monthly, and yearly agendas while communicating with external persons on the local, division, and district level. As choreographer, I devised weekly dance practice schedules, led a 3-person choreographer team, and taught dance moves and formations to students with little to no dance experience. In college, I was the intern President of Highlander Business Society where I oversaw and directedd our intern class through our weekly assignments and projects. I spearheaded communication and motivated to maintain order and morale in our class throughout the five weeks of our program. Additionally, I am currently also the Fundraising Chair of the Beta Theta Pledge Class of Alpha Phi Omega. I plan regular fundraisers and communicate with external organizations to organize fundraising collaborations, while calculating the costs and profits of each event, to reach our ultimate fundraising goal.
